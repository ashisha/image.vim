Features
=========
* Let's you open (preview) images in Vim!
* It's safe, never modifies the original image (unless you force write)


Requirements
============
* Vim with *python* support. You can verify if your Vim is compiled with python using:
  
  `vim --version | grep python`

* Also needs the Python library PIL. You can install PIL using `pip install Pillow`
